This wiki is designed to give you an insight on who's who, how we work and generally the process we use. As I’m sure you are aware, as with a lot of small companies and the nature of jobs we take on that the process can change slightly from job to job, but the project supervisor and producer will advise you if this is the case. Once you get started and get your teeth into some of the projects you will hopefully see how it all comes together.

If you think anything is missing please let us know.
